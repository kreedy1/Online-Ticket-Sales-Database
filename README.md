# Online-Ticket-Sales-Database

Welcome to my Online Ticket Sales Database Project where I utilize 7 tables: Category, event, date, listing, sales, venue and users.

Ticket Sales Database Analysis

Overview

This project involves analyzing an online ticket sales database using SQL and Python to extract insights and visualize data related to ticket sales, user preferences, and venue popularity.

Tasks

Total Tickets Sold by Venue: Retrieved the total number of tickets sold for each venue to understand venue popularity.

Top Venues by Ticket Sales: Identified the top 10 venues with the highest total ticket sales to determine the most successful venues.

Monthly Ticket Sales: Calculated the total number of tickets sold each month to analyze ticket sales trends over time.

Percentage of Users Liking Categories: Determined the percentage of users who like specific event categories (e.g., sports, concerts) to understand user preferences.

Biggest Concerts and Shows Over Time: Visualized the quantity of tickets sold and the price of tickets for concerts and shows over time using Python and Plotly.

Rolling Average of Ticket Sales: Calculated the rolling average of ticket sales over a 7-day period and visualized it alongside the actual ticket sales using Python and Matplotlib.

Top Venues by Average Ticket Price: Retrieved the top 10 venues with the highest average ticket prices to understand venue pricing strategies.
