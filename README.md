# Online-Ticket-Sales-Database

Welcome to my Online Ticket Sales Database Project where I utilize 7 tables: Category, event, date, listing, sales, venue and users.


Tasks Accomplished throughout this project using SQL and Python:

Total Tickets Sold by Venue: You retrieved the total number of tickets sold for each venue by joining the venue, event, and listing tables and aggregating the results. This provides insights into the popularity of different venues.

Top Venues by Ticket Sales: You obtained the top 10 venues with the highest total ticket sales by joining the venue, event, and listing tables, aggregating ticket sales, and ordering the results. This helps identify the most successful venues in terms of ticket sales.

Monthly Ticket Sales: You calculated the total number of tickets sold each month by joining the date and listing tables and grouping the data by month. This analysis provides a breakdown of ticket sales over time, allowing for trend analysis.

Percentage of Users Liking Categories: You determined the percentage of users who like specific categories (e.g., sports, concerts) by joining the category, event, and users tables and calculating the percentage of users liking each category. This offers insights into user preferences for different event categories.

Biggest Concerts and Shows Over Time: You visualized the quantity of tickets sold and the price of tickets for concerts and shows over time using Python and Plotly. This visualization helps identify trends and patterns in ticket sales for different types of events.

Rolling Average of Ticket Sales: You calculated the rolling average of ticket sales over a 7-day period and visualized it alongside the actual ticket sales using Python and Matplotlib. This helps smooth out fluctuations and identify long-term trends in ticket sales.

Top Venues by Average Ticket Price: You retrieved the top 10 venues with the highest average ticket prices by joining the venue, event, and listing tables, calculating the average ticket price for each venue, and ordering the results. This provides insights into the pricing strategies of different venues.
